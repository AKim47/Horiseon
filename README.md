# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This project is a code refactoring practice, in which I took existing code and updated the code to be more accessible
for future programmers to edit. Some examples of edits I made to the code include using HTML Semantic elements, fixing
broken links, including image alt attributes, and merging redundant CSS code. I also organized the HTML and CSS code
using comments, in which I labeled or described the section of the corresponding piece of code.
